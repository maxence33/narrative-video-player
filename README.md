# narrative-video-player

The narrative-video-player lets you create a narrative workflow within your video and give insights to what the video is going to reveal. And also provide a visual and easily navigatable timeframe. 

Navigation through progress bar can be deactivated, as it is no longer the primary way of navigating the video.
